# Task-2 Read from JSON file and create an excel report

Simple .Net Core console app. 

There are several ways (programatic & frameworks) to automate the process of creating and sending report via email. Because it is a simple task so I would go with an ETL framework i.e SSIS to create excel report and send via email.
